# hassio-config
Configuration files for my home automation system

My setup is based on Hassio running on a Raspberry Pie 3.
Connected to this is a Tellstick Duo so I can use all my Nexa 433 Mhz devices.
I also have a Aeonstick attached so I can use Zwave devices.

The devices I have acumulated over the years: 
Nexa plug-ins
Fibaro plug-ins
Fibaro motion sensors
Telldus magnet sensors
